								<h3><b>Java Programming Project</h3>
								<p3>This is a simple program that was used to demonstrate object oriented programming. There were six classes that made up this program
								   including: Person, Student, Undergraduate, Graduate, TestStudent, and ReadWriteFile. The main objective was to prompt the user to either
								   1, write data to a file; 2, read data from a file; 3, exit. If the user selected 1, they would be selected to enter a .txt file and enter
								   the student's first name, last name, math SAT score, verbal SAT score, writing SAT score, and their highschool GPA. Then the user was prompted
								   to enter a college decision, 1 for accepted, 2 for rejected, 3 for being on a waiting list, and 4 for no decision.   </p>

								<h3>Assembly Programming Project</h3>
								<p3>The purpose of this program is to take an employee name, phone number, social security number, and date of birth and store it into an
								   structure. Once it is stored into the array. Once it is stored into the structure, it is then to be written to a file. Once it is in the file, 
								   the structure is then cleared. To prove that it wrote to the file, it then prints the contents out again.

								<h3>AMD Ryzen 5600, GTX 1060, 16 GB DDR4-2400MZ
								</h3>
								<p3> This was a computer I built for a friend my freshman year at SVSU. He asked me if I could
								    and I was happy to do so. Since PC components cost so much, every opportunity given, I will 
									gladly build a computer.</p>

								<h3>Intel i7-7700k, GTX 1080, 32 GB DDR4-3200MZ</h3>
								<p3> This was a computer I built for a friend in the first half of 2020. He wanted to learn
									more about building computers so I showed him how. This was the early stages and I can be seen cable 
									managing.

								<h3>Intel i5-5600k, GTX 1070TI, 32 GB DDR4-3200MZ</h3>
								<p3> This is my personal computer. This computer used to be in a different case, not have
									 the Corsair AIO cooler, now has a 500 GB Samsung EVO NVME drive, 2 more exhaust fans
									 for increased airflow. Not the most powerful PC, but it runs cool and quiet.
